// A brief instruction on how to use your program:
// 1) Compile this source code file or run the precompiled file
// 2) Click on the white screen two times as two different points.
// They will be connected automatically by a white line and the circles will appear on the lines
// 3) You can click at two different points and repeat step 2
// 4) You can press 'a' to activate triangle and circle animation
// - If you press 'a', wait until the animation complete before you can do anything else
// 5) You can repeat step 3 or step 4, or press 'c' for half circle animation
// - If you press 'c', wait until the animation complete before you can do anything else
// 6. You can repeat step 3 / 4 / 5 or press 'Esc', or right click to exit

// Thank you!
